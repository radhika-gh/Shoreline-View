# 🌊 Shoreline View Simulation  

**A dynamic 2D coastal scene with interactive elements, built using OpenGL/GLUT.**  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🌅 **Day/Night Cycle**: Toggle between sunrise and moonlit scenes.  
- 🛥️ **Interactive Boats**: Control two boats with keyboard (`A/D` for Boat 1, `Q/E` for Boat 2).  
- 🚗 **Animated Cars**: Smooth movement with spinning wheels (Start/Stop with `C`).  
- 🌧️ **Rain Effect**: Realistic rain simulation (Toggle with `R`).  
- 🏐 **Volleyball Animation**: Throw a ball across the net (Press `V`).  
- 🔦 **Dynamic Lighting**: Car headlights and lamp posts in night mode.
